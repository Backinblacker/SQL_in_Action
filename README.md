-- What do you think makes a successful AirBnB rental in this market? What factors seem to be at play the most?

-- Write a few sentences and include them with your project submission in the README file 

I believe that a successful AirBnB depends on the goal of the person who owns it. Some people use them to help pay their mortgage, while others use it so they do not have to have a job. Mesuring that success makes it personalized and unique. Every person has different goals and each person wants to know different data in order to make decisions.

Personally I think a successful AirBnB would almost never be empty. These properties don't make money if they sit empty. I would be focused on finding the perfect price point and location to keep it rented. I'm certain that I could charge more, but it would be full more often.
